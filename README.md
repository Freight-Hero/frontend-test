# Load Management System

A modern and efficient load management system built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Features

- **Load Management**
  - Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for loads
  - Real-time data updates
  - Efficient state management using React Context
  - Async data fetching with simulated API delay for realistic development experience

- **Data Visualization**
  - Clean and responsive table layout
  - Pagination for better performance
  - Column sorting functionality
  - Search functionality for quick data access
  - Status filtering for better organization

- **User Experience**
  - Responsive design for desktop-first experience with mobile compatibility
  - Skeleton loading states for better perceived performance
  - Accessible components following WCAG guidelines
  - Intuitive navigation and interactions
  - Focus feedback for keyboard navigation

## Technical Decisions

### Architecture
- **State Management**: Used React Context API for its simplicity and efficiency, avoiding unnecessary complexity of external state management libraries
- **Component Structure**: Modular architecture with reusable components for better maintainability and scalability
- **Code Organization**: Clear folder structure following best practices for React applications
- **Data Fetching**: Implemented async data fetching with simulated delay to mimic real-world API behavior

### UI/UX
- **Styling**: Implemented Tailwind CSS with shadcn components for consistent design and optimal performance
- **Responsiveness**: Desktop-first approach with responsive layouts for mobile compatibility
- **Accessibility**: Built with accessibility in mind, following WCAG guidelines
- **Performance**: Optimized loading states and efficient data handling

### Code Quality
- **TypeScript**: Strong typing for better code reliability and developer experience
- **ESLint**: Strict linting rules to maintain code quality and consistency
- **Modularity**: Components and features are well-separated for better maintainability

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
